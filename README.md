## üß† Project Structure

- `src/main/java/com/example/inventory_backend/`
    - `Product.java`: Product Model
    - `ProductController.java`: HTTP Endpoints (/products)
- `pom.xml`: Maven configuration

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Validation & Error Handling

- Uses Jakarta Bean Validation annotations (@NotNull, @Size, etc.)
- Global @ExceptionHandler returns structured field-level errors

---

## üîß CORS Configuration

To allow cross-origin request from the frontend (http://localhost:8080), we enabled a basico CORS filter in Spring Boot.

---

## ‚úÖ Testing

- JUnit 5 for unit tests (service layer)
- WebMvcTest for controller endpoint testing
- Uses Mockito and AssertJ for assertions and mocking

```bash
mvn test
   ```

---

## üìå Notes

- Data is stored in memory (no database required)
- Designed for prototyping and local development
- Easily extendable with a real database using JPA
